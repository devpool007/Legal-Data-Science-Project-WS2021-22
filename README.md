# Legal-Data-Science-Project-WS2021-22

I would recommend reading the Project Report PDF in the repo to get more insights about the project and what frameworks and NLP methodologies are implemented here.

## Code Instructions
- Run analyze.py as intended by the project
- I have included a few unlabeled BVA cases in the unlabeled folder to test on but you guys can download and try any other BVA decisions or other documents and see how the program performs :)
- PLEASE enter the path name in quotations
- Example run:
- Open command prompt
- Enter the following command: python analyze.py “unlabeled\file_name.txt”
- Code runs yay!
